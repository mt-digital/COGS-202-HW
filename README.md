## Formal grammar homework

See first the jupyter notebook
[PerceptualSymbolGrammar](formal-grammar/PerceptualSymbolGrammar.ipynb)
which uses the general object-oriented formal grammar/language framework in
[formal-grammar/grammar.py](formal-grammar/grammar.py). Unfortunately the LaTeX output 
is very tiny in the GitHub rendering. Zoom in or run the .ipynb locally to see it better.
